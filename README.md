This repository contains work from my Emerging Systems Architecture and Technology class at SNHU


<h2> Summarize the project and what problem it was solving. </h2>

This project was programming a TI SimpleLink Wi-Fi CC3220S LaunchPad to act as a thermometer. The way this was achieved was by coding the LaunchPad to record the temperature, send that information to the program, and then the program would tell the LaunchPad to turn its LED on or off. There were two buttons on the side of the LaunchPad that could manipulate the set temperature. The left one would -1 from the set point and the right would +1 to the set point. When the temperature was below the set point, the LED would turn on, indicating that the heater was now on. The LED would remain on until the temperature was above the set point. The program also kept track of tasks and checked those tasks in differnt periods. It also relayed information to the console every second about what the temerature was, what the set point was, if the heat was on (1 or 0) and the total time.

<h2> What did you do particularly well? </h2>

I think what I did well was sticking to this project until I was able to figure it out and code it correctly. This class took me a little while to finally have "Ok I get it now" moment but when that finally happened, I was able to finish the project up to the requirements. It was very rewarding to finally have the program work after a few weeks of working on the final project.


<h2> Where could you improve? </h2>

I'm pretty new to embedded systems so there is a lot I could improve at when it comes to that. When it comes to this project specifcally I think I could improve my diagrams and explinations. Documentation is very important and it is very helpful to a third party looking at the project.

<h2> What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network? </h2>

I enjoyed Code Composer Studio so I will be using that in the future when applicable. This was also my first try with C so I am happy that I am able to add that to laungages that I am familiar with. 

<h2> What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work? </h2>

The knowledge that I have picked up from this class will be transferable to any embedded systerm project that I do in the future. Also the diagram and explinations have reprocity across differnt types of programming so those skills will also come in handy.

<h2> How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable? </h2>

I tried to make it readable by adding comments to the code that I added to make it easier to follow along. I also utlized white space to make the program more readable.
